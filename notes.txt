Some fundamentals based on the financial statements:

For the last few years, the company had a good cash-realization ratio (measures how close a 
company’s net income is to being realized in cash). A ratio above 1.0 is good, which MEI had 
for several years.

Return on equity was a healthy 16% and was more or less similar for the last few years as well.

Debt to equity was under 1.0 as well as the total debt ratio. The company also had good cash 
reserves in the event of a downturn, which was good considering we’re still dealing with the 
covid-19 pandemic.

Net profit margins were good hovering around 10%, the net worth ratio had been growing, and 
there were no red flags such as rapidly declining sales or earnings.

The P/E ratio was around 10 when historically it had been anywhere from 12 to 26. The price-to 
book ratio was also around 1.40.

More importantly, its earnings to net tangible assets ratio was 40% and its price to tangible 
book value ratio was about 3.30. For the last couple years, it had been between 3.50 and 6.00.

Determining an appropriate value:

So, I knew the company was fundamentally sound or at least had been stable during the past 
several years. Now I just had to determine a reasonable estimate of what the company was worth. 
If you figure out the discounted owner earnings from the last several years, you get a present 
value estimate of about $80-90 a share. (I assumed a 5-year growth rate of 8%, a discount rate 
of 5%, and a good margin of safety).

For those who aren’t familiar with owner earnings, you could also do a discounted free cash 
flow analysis and get similar results, but I recommend you learn about both and how to calculate 
them. Now, my own estimate of $80-90 a share could still be way off, but I’m just looking for an 
indication as to whether the stock could be undervalued. If the stock price were $27 and my 
estimate had been $30, I would have just moved on to another stock. In this case, I knew it had 
potential. Once I considered the present economic environment and other items, I settled on a 
present value estimate of about $40 a share.
